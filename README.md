# Shipping-website

This repository contains a cruise website that I have made to teach myself coding in html, css and Javascript
The website is not perfect and can be improved as it is filled with bugs, 
however this is so that I can reflect on my journey from when I started teaching myself web development 
using nothing but documentation, youtube and coffee
